<!-- Accordion Component Implementation Guide -->
<!--
Project Philosophy:
- No build tools or package managers
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with HTMX and Hyperscript
- Copy-paste friendly implementation
- Accessible and semantic HTML
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS

Task:
1. Create an Accordion component that follows the established component structure
2. Use semantic HTML elements with proper ARIA attributes
3. Implement interactive behavior using Hyperscript (no external dependencies)
4. Style with TailwindCSS using the project's color system
5. Ensure responsive design and accessibility
6. Add smooth animations using animate.min.css (slideInDown/slideOutUp)
7. Allow only one accordion item to be open at a time
8. Include proper focus management and keyboard navigation

Implementation Plan:
1. HTML Structure:
   - Follow the component structure pattern from other components
   - Use semantic elements (section, h3, button, div)
   - Implement proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls, role="region")
   - Use data-state attributes to track open/closed states
   - Include chevron icons that rotate when expanded

2. Styling:
   - Use TailwindCSS classes for styling
   - Apply project color system (background, foreground, muted, border)
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Style focus states for accessibility

3. Interactivity:
   - Use Hyperscript for click handling
   - Toggle data-state attributes between "open" and "closed"
   - Show/hide content panels with animations
   - Rotate chevron icons based on state
   - Ensure only one item open at a time

4. Animation:
   - Use animate__slideInDown for opening
   - Use animate__slideOutUp for closing
   - Apply animate__animated class to content panels

5. Accessibility:
   - Proper ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management
   - Screen reader compatibility
