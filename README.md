# HTMX + Hyperscript + TailwindCSS UI Library

Welcome to my HTMX, Hyperscript, and TailwindCSS UI library! This project is inspired by popular UI frameworks such as **Headless UI**, **ShadCN**, and **Skeleton UI**. Designed to be **completely free**, this library allows you to **copy and paste** every component with ease, enabling fast and efficient web development.

[Demo](https://ar-92.github.io/UI/src/index)

> **Status**: ðŸš§ Work in Progress - Continuously evolving

## Why This Library?

### 1. **Pure Simplicity**
   - Every UI component is crafted with simplicity in mind, utilizing **HTMX** for dynamic interactions, **Hyperscript** for event handling, and **TailwindCSS** for styling.
   - No unnecessary complexityâ€”just **minimal code** to get you the result you want.

### 2. **Copy-Paste Friendly**
   - Our library is all about speed and convenience. Every element is **copy-pasteable** so you can integrate components directly into your projects without any hassle.
   - Forget about complex setups or configurations. Just grab what you need and start building!

### 3. **Inspired by the Best**
   - Drawing inspiration from **Headless UI**, **ShadCN**, and **Skeleton UI**, this library takes the best practices from these frameworks and offers them in a streamlined package.
   - Whether you're looking for flexibility, accessibility, or beautiful design, this library delivers a balanced blend of all three.

### 4. **Tailored for TailwindCSS**
   - TailwindCSS makes it easy to customize and theme components to fit your brand or project's design language. With this UI library, you get **pre-built components** ready to adapt to any style.
   - From buttons and forms to advanced modals and grids, everything is built with utility-first CSS in mind.

### 5. **Dynamic and Interactive by Default**
   - Powered by **HTMX** and **Hyperscript**, our components are designed to be interactive and dynamic without the need for JavaScript libraries like React or Vue.
   - You get **lightweight**, fast-loading components that deliver a **great user experience** without the overhead.

## Tech Stack

- **[HTMX](https://htmx.org/)** - High power tools for HTML
- **[Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/)** - Small scripting language for the web
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework (v3.4.17)
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No build tools required

## Recent Improvements

### âœ… Tailwind CSS v4 to v3 Migration
We've successfully resolved critical styling issues by downgrading from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3.4.17:
- Fixed missing utility classes (rounded-lg, mr-4, border-border, etc.)
- Restored proper class generation for all components
- Improved CSS file size from 1 line to 4,271 lines with complete utilities
- Enhanced content scanning and class detection

### âœ… Design System Consistency
- Unified spacing, typography, and component styling across all pages
- Standardized layout structures for components, examples, and documentation
- Improved responsive design patterns
- Better dark/light mode implementation
- **Consistent Border Radius System** - Defined and implemented a standardized border radius scale

### âœ… Performance & Reliability
- Optimized build process with proper Tailwind CSS compilation
- Fixed missing CSS classes that were breaking component styling
- Enhanced cross-browser compatibility

## Current Progress

- ðŸ“… **Actively Developing** - Regular updates and new components
- ðŸŽ¨ **Design System** - Consistent styling and component patterns
- âš¡ **Performance** - Optimized for fast loading and interactions
- ðŸŒ™ **Dark Mode** - Full light/dark theme support

## Design System

### Border Radius Consistency
We've implemented a consistent border radius system across all components:

| Class | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `rounded-none` | 0px | Sharp edges, no rounding |
| `rounded-xs` | 2px | Very subtle rounding for small elements |
| `rounded-sm` | 4px | Small rounding for badges, tags, small buttons |
| `rounded` | 6px | **Default rounding** for most UI components |
| `rounded-md` | 8px | Medium rounding for cards, larger components |
| `rounded-lg` | 12px | Large rounding for containers and sections |
| `rounded-xl` | 16px | Extra large rounding for hero sections |
| `rounded-full` | 9999px | Circular elements |
