# Hello UI - HTMX + Hyperscript + TailwindCSS Component Library

Welcome to Hello UI, a comprehensive component library built with HTMX, Hyperscript, and TailwindCSS. This project draws inspiration from leading UI frameworks including **Headless UI**, **ShadCN**, and **Skeleton UI**. As a completely free and open-source solution, this library enables developers to seamlessly integrate components through simple copy-and-paste functionality, facilitating rapid and efficient web application development.

### 2. **Seamless Integration**
   - Built for developer efficiency and convenience. Every element is designed for **straightforward copy-and-paste integration**, allowing you to incorporate components directly into your projects without friction.
   - Eliminates complex setups or configurations. Simply select the components you need and begin building immediately.

### 3. **Industry-Leading Inspiration**
   - Carefully curated best practices from renowned frameworks including **Headless UI**, **ShadCN**, and **Skeleton UI**, consolidated into a cohesive and streamlined package.

### 4. **Enhanced Data Visualizations**
   - All charts and data visualizations feature a harmonious color palette that complements the overall UI theme
   - Refined styling for superior readability and seamless integration with the comprehensive design system
   - Fully responsive design optimized for all device sizes and screen resolutions
   - Interactive charts enhanced with Hyperscript-powered animations and transitions
   - Consistent border styling with standardized radius and shadow effects
   - Delivers an optimal balance of flexibility, accessibility, and aesthetic excellence.

### 5. **TailwindCSS Optimized**
   - Fully optimized for TailwindCSS, enabling effortless customization and theming to align with your brand identity or project design language. This UI library provides **production-ready components** that adapt to any visual style.
   - Comprehensive coverage from fundamental buttons and forms to sophisticated modals and grid systems, all constructed with utility-first CSS principles.

### 6. **Inherently Dynamic and Interactive**
   - Engineered with **HTMX** and **Hyperscript** as the foundation, our components are inherently interactive and dynamic without requiring heavy JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.
   - Delivers **lightweight**, high-performance components that provide an **exceptional user experience** while minimizing resource overhead.

## Tech Stack

- **[HTMX](https://htmx.org/)** - High power tools for HTML
- **[Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/)** - Small scripting language for the web
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework (v3.4.17)
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No build tools required

## Recent Enhancements

## Design System

### Border Radius Consistency
We've implemented a consistent border radius system across all components:

| Class | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `rounded-none` | 0px | Sharp edges, no rounding |
| `rounded-xs` | 2px | Very subtle rounding for small elements |
| `rounded-sm` | 4px | Small rounding for badges, tags, small buttons |
| `rounded` | 6px | **Default rounding** for most UI components |
| `rounded-md` | 8px | Medium rounding for cards, larger components |
| `rounded-lg` | 12px | Large rounding for containers and sections |
| `rounded-xl` | 16px | Extra large rounding for hero sections |
| `rounded-full` | 9999px | Circular elements |

See [DESIGN_SYSTEM_BORDER_RADIUS.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM_BORDER_RADIUS.md) for detailed usage guidelines.
