## Why This Library?

### 1. **Pure Simplicity**
   - Every UI component is crafted with simplicity in mind, utilizing **HTMX** for dynamic interactions, **Hyperscript** for event handling, and **TailwindCSS** for styling.
   - No unnecessary complexity—just **minimal code** to get you the result you want.

### 2. **Copy-Paste Friendly**
   - Our library is all about speed and convenience. Every element is **copy-pasteable** so you can integrate components directly into your projects without any hassle.
   - Forget about complex setups or configurations. Just grab what you need and start building!

### 3. **Inspired by the Best**
   - Drawing inspiration from **Headless UI**, **ShadCN**, and **Skeleton UI**, this library takes the best practices from these frameworks and offers them in a streamlined package.
   - Whether you're looking for flexibility, accessibility, or beautiful design, this library delivers a balanced blend of all three.

### 4. **Tailored for TailwindCSS**
